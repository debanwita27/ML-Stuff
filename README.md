  <h3>Update (Mar 23, 2023)</h3>
  
  I'll be picking this repo back up for most of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects since I've garnered a newfound appreciation for this field. I'd be lying if I said Stable Diffusion(Yes, Midjourney) and Natural Language Models(Yes, ChatGPT) had nothing to do with this "appreciation".  
  
Either way, I've taken up a few math courses and am cuurently following <a href="https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106184">this wonderful course</a> and the <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">mandatory ebook</a> for Deep Learning. 

In the meantime, I'm also re-learning how to use TensorFlow and PyTorch so I have a few things lined up.  

- anything starting with 20BCSD80 is part of the course I took a couple years back
- I'm hoping to make this a compendium of sorts, for any ML stuff I learn. Hopefully, I'd make projects big enough to warrant their own repos after some time, but for now, I'll be using this  
- I'm making an index

<h3>Initial commit</h3>
Projects for a ML course that I attended last year.  
How late is better late, exactly?  
  
  Things I learnt :   
  - why take courses when you have KDnuggets?  
  - kaggle datasets are a hit or miss  
  - datasets that include conversations have enough material for a 10-season daily soap
